        <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite hobby is:</p>

        <ul class="hobby-list">
            <li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> Sleeping has always been one of my favorite coping mechanism. It's one of the things I do whenever I feel sad and it's also a thing that I really enjoy doing whenever I want to rest.</li>
            <li><strong>Painting:</strong>Painting has always been a hobby of mine ever since I was a kid. It's a shared hobby between me and my parents. Whenever we want to make some family time, we usually do activities like painting.</li>
            <li><strong>Studying:</strong>I'm a strudent with passion with my studies. I really care for my studies at school and usually the things I do whenever I'm bored is studying. I really enjoy learning new things especially at things I'm interested or curious about.</li>
            <li><strong>Singing:</strong>Other than painting, singing is also one of my favorite things to do with my parents. And it's also a shared hobby between us. It has always been my passion to sing confidentally infront of a lot od peaople.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of these hobbies adds something meaningful to my life, and I think without these, I feel like I'm not full or I'm  not enough.</p>

    <h1>my ambitions in life</h1>
    <h2>january,30,2025</h2>
    <h3>As a kid who grew up in a household with so much passion and ambition, I have always adored those who fulfill their ambitions in their life.
        One of the people who actually inspired me with my ambition is my uncle. He didn't really grew up in an environment where people had money to afford to go to a good university
        however, with his passion to fulfill his dreams with desires to be a great pharmacist in the future, he managed to graduate with an accomplishment of being a summa cum laude and being the breadwinner in his family. 
        I believe that being devoted or being motivated brings you to a desire of wanting success in your life too. Because of my uncle's desire of wanting success in his life, he awakened something in my core, in my soul, in the fire inside my 
        body fueling the desire of wanting to be like him too. And because of that I find myself wanting to be him, achieving his dream, having to be able to help his family, and being able to be something he wanted when he was still in the process of who is he today.
        My ambition in life is to be something I want to become today. I want to be successful, and to be able to buy whatever I want. I want to be something that my parents weren't able to be. I believe that acheiving this dream can also maybe awaken that desire they too had before 
        that they could't achieve before. And that enough is a big ambition for me to fulfill.
